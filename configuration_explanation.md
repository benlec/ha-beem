## Beem Solar Integration Configuration

The integration is already properly configured to handle credentials securely through Home Assistant's configuration flow system. Here's how it works:

1. The `config_flow.py` file defines a configuration flow that prompts users for their username and password when setting up the integration
2. The credentials are not hardcoded anywhere in the code - they are collected through the UI when users add the integration
3. When users install and configure the component, they will:
   - Add the integration through the Home Assistant UI
   - Be presented with a form asking for their username and password
   - Have their credentials validated against the Beem Solar API
   - Have the credentials stored securely in Home Assistant's configuration

This is the recommended way to handle credentials in Home Assistant integrations, as it:
- Keeps credentials secure
- Provides a user-friendly setup process
- Validates credentials before saving them
- Allows users to manage their own credentials

No additional configuration is needed - this is already implemented correctly and securely.
