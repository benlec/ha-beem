# File Location Verification

Both files in question have been located and verified:

1. `brand_images.md` is present in the workspace root directory
   - Contains sections about brand image requirements and best practices
   - Includes guidance about image locations, names, and usage

2. `configuration_explanation.md` is present in the workspace root directory
   - Contains information about Beem Solar Integration Configuration

The files were not lost or deleted in any renaming process - they are both accessible and contain their expected content. They are located in the root directory of the project.
