# HACS Configuration Explanation

The `hacs.json` file has been created with the following configuration:

```json
{
    "name": "Beem Energy",
    "content_in_root": false,
    "render_readme": true,
    "homeassistant": "2023.1.0"
}
```

Here's why these settings were chosen:

1. **name**: Used "Beem Energy" to match the integration's name in manifest.json, keeping it simple and consistent
2. **content_in_root**: Set to `false` because the integration is properly structured in the `custom_components` directory
3. **render_readme**: Set to `true` to ensure the README.md is displayed in HACS
4. **homeassistant**: Set to "2023.1.0" as a reasonable minimum version that supports the integration's requirements

Regarding the suggested configuration:
- The suggested name was longer and included "(Int√©gration non officielle pour Beem Energy)" - while this is informative, it's better to keep the name simple and consistent with the manifest
- The suggested country "FR" field is optional and not strictly necessary
- The suggested HA version "2025.3.4" would be too restrictive as it's a future version that doesn't exist yet

The configuration provided will work well with HACS while maintaining compatibility with a broader range of Home Assistant installations.
